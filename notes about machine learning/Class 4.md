### Visualizing the cost function
This content focuses on visualizing the cost function in linear regression, enhancing understanding of how model parameters affect predictions.

Understanding the Cost Function

- The cost function J(w, b) is central to linear regression, aiming to ==minimize the error between predicted and actual values.==
- Visualizations include a ==3D surface plot== representing the cost function with parameters w and b, resembling a bowl shape.

Visualizing with Contour Plots

- Contour plots provide a ==2D representation of the cost function, showing levels of equal cost values (ellipses) for different parameter combinations.==
- Each point on the contour plot corresponds to a specific model function, illustrating how different parameter choices impact predictions.

Interpreting the Visualizations

- The minimum point of the cost function indicates the ==optimal parameters for the model.==
- Understanding these visualizations aids in grasping how adjustments to w and b influence the model's performance in predicting outcomes.
