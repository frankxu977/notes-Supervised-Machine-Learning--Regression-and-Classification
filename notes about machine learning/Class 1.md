### Applications of machine learning

This course introduces the fundamentals of machine learning and its practical applications.

**Overview of Machine Learning**

- Machine learning is a sub-field of AI focused on enabling machines to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.
- It is widely used in various applications, including speech recognition, web search, and self-driving cars.

**Importance and Growth of Machine Learning**

- The demand for machine learning skills is high due to its potential to create significant value across multiple industries, estimated to reach an additional $13 trillion annually by 2030.
- Many industries are expected to be transformed by machine learning, making it an exciting field to explore.

**Future Aspirations in AI**

- The long-term goal in AI research is to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which remains a distant objective.
- Learning algorithms inspired by human brain functions are seen as a pathway to advance towards AGI.

### What is machine learning?

This course content introduces the concept of machine learning, focusing on its definition and applications.

Definition of Machine Learning

- Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as the study that enables computers to learn without explicit programming.
- An example is Samuel's checkers program, which improved its game play by playing thousands of games against itself.

Types of Machine Learning

- The two main types are ==supervised learning and unsupervised learning,== with supervised learning being more widely used in real-world applications.
- ==supervised learning used most in real-world application==
- The course will cover various learning algorithms, emphasizing ==practical advice for applying these algorithms effectively.==(giving totals to user)

Practical Application and Best Practices

- The course aims to equip learners with both the tools and the skills to apply machine learning effectively.

- It highlights the importance of understanding best practices to avoid common pitfalls in developing machine learning systems.



### Supervised learning part 1

The course content focuses on the concept of supervised machine learning, which is ==a key area in the field of machine learning==.


Understanding Supervised Learning

- Supervised learning involves algorithms that ==learn from input-output pairs==, where the algorithm is trained on examples with known correct outputs.
- **"Learn from being given right answers"**
- ==The learning process allows the algorithm to make predictions on new, unseen inputs based on the patterns it has learned.==

Applications of Supervised Learning

- Examples include spam detection i==n emails, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising, self-driving cars, and visual inspection in manufacturing.==
- Each application involves ==training the model with labeled data to predict outcomes for new inputs.==

Types of Supervised Learning

- The content introduces two main types of supervised learning: ==regression and classification.==
- Regression ==**predicts continuous values**== (e.g., housing prices), while classification deals with ==**discrete categories**== (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

### Supervised learning part 2

The course content focuses on supervised learning, specifically regression and classification algorithms.

Supervised Learning Overview

- Supervised learning algorithms predict input-output mappings, with ==regression predicting continuous numbers and classification predicting discrete categories.==
- Classification algorithms, such as those used in breast cancer detection, categorize tumors as either ==benign (0) or malignant (1).==(只有0 and 1)

==Classification Algorithms==

- In classification, the ==output is limited to a small set of categories==, unlike regression which predicts any number.
- ==Classification can involve multiple categories,== such as different types of cancer, and the terms "output classes" and "output categories" are often used interchangeably.

Input Variables in Classification

- Classification ==can utilize multiple input variables==, such as tumor size and patient age, to improve predictions. ==（how to find a boundary line)==
